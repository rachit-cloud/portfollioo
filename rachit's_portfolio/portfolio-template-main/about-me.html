                <p class="bold center">Playing</p>
                <p>"I love playing a variety of games, from engaging video games that challenge my strategy and reflexes to board games that bring friends and family together for fun, friendly competition. In my free time, you'll often find me enjoying outdoor sports, like soccer or basketball, which not only help me stay active but also allow me to connect with others. Playing games, whether online or in person, is my way of unwinding, learning new skills, and spending quality time with the people around me.

                    What I enjoy most is the sense of teamwork and communication that comes with multiplayer games, especially when collaborating with others toward a common goal. It’s a great way to build relationships and improve problem-solving skills. Beyond that, I find that games often allow me to escape into new worlds, whether through exciting narratives or fast-paced action, and they help me maintain a healthy balance between relaxation and mental stimulation. Games, for me, are more than just entertainment—they’re a way to connect, learn, and grow."</p>

                <img class="box margin-auto hobbies" src="assets/coding.png" alt="hobbies3">
                <p class="bold center">Coding</p>
                <p>"I have a strong passion for coding, as it allows me to bring ideas to life by solving complex problems and building creative solutions. Whether it's developing websites, creating apps, or learning new programming languages, coding challenges me to think critically and continuously improve my skills. It's incredibly rewarding to see my work come to fruition and know that I've created something functional and impactful.

                    I enjoy the process of breaking down big challenges into smaller, manageable tasks and finding efficient ways to implement solutions. Coding has taught me to be patient and persistent, as sometimes the path to solving a problem isn’t always straightforward. What excites me most is the endless possibilities for innovation—there's always something new to learn, whether it's a new framework, algorithm, or tool. Every project I work on strengthens my ability to adapt and think outside the box, and I’m always eager to take on new challenges to continue growing as a developer."</p>

                <p class="bold center">Wierd stuff</p>
                <p>"I've always been drawn to weird and unconventional things, whether it's exploring obscure hobbies, diving into strange documentaries, or collecting odd facts that most people wouldn't think twice about. From learning about the history of bizarre foods to experimenting with quirky DIY projects, I love indulging in things that are outside the norm. One of my favorite things to do is wander through thrift stores to find the strangest items, whether it's a vintage toy or an odd piece of artwork that sparks my imagination.

                    I also enjoy diving into niche internet communities, where people share their weirdest discoveries and discuss topics most wouldn't even think of, like cryptozoology, time travel theories, or obscure conspiracy theories. There’s something fascinating about the unknown and the unexplained, and I’m always eager to explore the most out-of-the-box ideas that challenge the way we think about the world. My fascination with the weird and unusual keeps me curious, and I find that embracing the strange things in life helps me think differently and stay open to new, unexpected experiences."</p>
